#TODO
when the server starts I want it to load a config file. the config contains existing repositories

it should not just create a default directory. The client needs to choose which repository to connect to or create a new one.

The server needs to receive commands on a seperate channel for a connected client. preferably it needs to move the connection to a different thread
so that its able to accept another connection

8/20/25
Server and client launch seperate threads for file streaming on a seperate tcp connection
you can connect to a repository on the server and stream files to it
#TODO
fix the server so the file streaming channel is only available to the connected client not anybody
store the handles created by the file streaming threads so we can shut them down properly without crashing

fix the ui so that the new repository and disconnect buttons are only visible when connected to the server
make it so that the backup options are only available when connected to a repository
add a button to enable/disable live file streaming
fix the repository selection so that you cant lauch multiple client side streaming threads

8/21/25
Broke up the server and client streaming logic so that the streaming services exist in their own seperate data structures to improve code modularity
implemented proper response send/read formatting for the file streaming server and file streaming client

8/24/25
ui workflow is fixed and displays connections statuses for the main command channel and file streaming channels.
auto-connect is now an implemented features
each repository has its own config with seperate watch directories and options configurable
no longer need to manually save the config
fixed initiallization workflow bugs

next we need to start adding info available about a connected repository, 
such as maybe the size of the folder or the number of files stored in the folder, its also necessary to display a tree of subdirs within the repository
also need to make sure users cant create a new repository with a blank name
add remove repository features also
when a tcp stream cuts we need to update the connection statuses
when a file is uploaded we need to create the relative path on the repo even if its nested in n folders
