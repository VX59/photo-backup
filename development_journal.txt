when the server starts I want it to load a config file. the config contains existing repositories

it should not just create a default directory. The client needs to choose which repository to connect to or create a new one.

The server needs to receive commands on a seperate channel for a connected client. preferably it needs to move the connection to a different thread
so that its able to accept another connection
